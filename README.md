# Bayesian machine Learning
Lecturers: RÃ©mi Bardenet and Julyan Arbel

### Evaluation
The student seminar will take place on Friday, 13 March, 8:30-12:30, at Amphi Curie.

There are 16 projets, so we will allow 15 minutes by project: 10 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for questions. The schedule is given on this [Framacalc sheet](https://lite.framacalc.org/9eu9-mva-bml) for indication only, everyone is expected to attend all presentations. In your 10 minutes, you should
* introduce the problem that the paper solves,
* describe the solution and how the paper validates it (a proof, an experiment?),
* explain how you've gone beyond the paper if you managed to do so.

10 minutes is short, and we will cut you at 10 sharp, so prepare well, rehearse, avoid being too technical, and make sure each project member speaks. *Avoid slides and rather use the blackboard* if you need a support. If you really need slides, e.g. to show the results of an experiment, we only allow **two slides max per project**. We ask that you send us the slides in pdf, 24 hours before the exam. We will concatenate the slides beforehand and bring a computer, to keep up with our tight schedule.
